Description: PRSHelpDesk is a package that assists with data preparation for PRS analyses and contains several functions for evaluating PRS, performing linear combination of multiple PRS, and transforming a PRS to account for genetic ancestry. Also contains a function for estimation of a p+t PRS using a simple window-based pruning approach and a p-value threshold. Finally, includes functions for annotating a PRS with local ancestry information and estimating partial local ancestry specific PRS. Overall, this package was designed for use in cohorts with complex population structure (i.e. admixture). 
    This package also depends on PLINK and bcftools. Both should be installed prior to use.
